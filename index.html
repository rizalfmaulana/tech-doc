        <h3>Getting started with CSS</h3>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This
          module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
        </p>
        <h3>Prequisities</h3>
        <p>Before starting this module, you should have:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it, consuming the content.)</li>
          <li>A basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding of how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files.</li>
          <li>Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.</li>
        </ol>

          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
        </p>
        <h3>What is CSS for?</h3>
        <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
        <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
        <p>
          Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or
          printer.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS syntax</h3>
        <p>
          CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large
          red text."
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
h1{
color: red;
font-size: 5em;
}</pre
          >
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Getting_started_with_CSS">
        <header>Getting started with CSS</header>
        <p>In this article we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical things about the language along the way.</p>
        <h3>Adding CSS to our document</h3>
        <p>
          The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we
          will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
        </p>
        <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.</p>
        <p>To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document:</p>
        <code><pre>p, li {
color: green;
}</pre></code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_is_structured">
        <header>How CSS is structured</header>
        <p>An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.</p>
        <code><pre>h1 {
color: blue;
background-color: yellow;
border: 1px solid black;
}
          
p {
 color: red;
}</pre></code>
        <h3>Adding a class</h3>
        <p>So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>
        <p>In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>
        <code><pre>.special {
color: orange;
font-weight: bold;
}</pre></code>
        <h3>Styling things based on state</h3>
        <p>The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial is the ability to style things based on their state. A straightforward example of this is when styling links. When we style a link we need to target the <a> (anchor) element. This has different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited, being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the process of being clicked (activated). You can use CSS to target these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink and visited links green.</p>
        <code><pre>a:link {
color: pink;
}
          
a:visited {
color: green;
}</pre></code>

        <header>How CSS works</header>
        <p>We have learned the basics of CSS, what it is for and how to write simple stylesheets. In this lesson we will take a look at how a browser takes CSS and HTML and turns that into a webpage.</p>
        <h3>How does CSS actually work?</h3>
        <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
            <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.</li>
            <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
            <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>
            <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.</li>
            <li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).</li>
        </ol>
